👋🏽 Hi, my name is 𝙆𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙟

🎓 Soon to be grad with a Master’s in Data Science (Dec 2021)

🌇 Based out in Boston, with a passion for gleaning insights from data and making an impact.

📚 I have about 3 years of industry experience where I have been providing solutions to business problems with help of data. I have closely worked right from requirement gathering to product delivery in form of data analysis, machine learning-powered solutions, feature engineering, data - pipeline development, app development, software development, others.

💻 Currently, I am seeking an opportunity where I can extinguish my curiosity about data and provide the best solution to challenging problems. I have previously worked as a Data Scientist, Statistical Programmer, and Software Developer at prestigious firms like EY (Ernst and Young), Biogen and The Tjx Companies Inc.
